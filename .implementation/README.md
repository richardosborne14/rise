# Implementation Tracking

This directory contains detailed implementation logs for the Rise project. Each task is documented with design decisions, challenges, solutions, and lessons learned.

## Purpose

- **Track Progress**: Document what was done, how long it took, what worked
- **Preserve Knowledge**: Every decision and its rationale is recorded
- **Enable Review**: Human reviewers can understand context and approach
- **Support Future Development**: Patterns and lessons guide future work

## File Naming Convention

- **Format**: `task-X.Y-descriptive-name.md`
- **Example**: `task-0.1-file-watcher.md`
- **X**: Phase number
- **Y**: Task number within phase

## When to Create a New File

Create a new task file when:
- Starting a new task from CLINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Beginning a significant feature or component
- Starting a new phase of the project

## When to Update a File

Update the task file:
- After each milestone is completed
- When design decisions are made
- When challenges are encountered and solved
- When tests are written and pass/fail
- When human review is completed
- When the task is finished

## What to Document

### Required Sections
1. **Task Overview** - Objective, success criteria, references
2. **Milestones** - Each significant step with confidence rating
3. **Design Decisions** - What options were considered, what was chosen, why
4. **Implementation Notes** - Challenges, solutions, code locations
5. **Test Results** - Unit, integration, manual testing outcomes
6. **Human Review** - Feedback received and actions taken
7. **Lessons Learned** - What worked, what didn't, reusable patterns

### Optional Sections
- Performance benchmarks (if applicable)
- Security considerations (if applicable)
- Edge cases handled
- Technical debt created
- Future improvements

## Confidence Ratings

All milestones and decisions must include confidence ratings (1-10):

- **9-10**: High confidence, proven approach, well-tested
- **7-8**: Good confidence, may need minor refinement
- **5-6**: Moderate confidence, needs more testing or review
- **3-4**: Low confidence, requires human review
- **1-2**: Very low confidence, stop and get help

**Rule**: If confidence <8, human review is required before proceeding.

## Using Templates

### Starting a New Task

1. Copy `templates/task-template.md`
2. Save to appropriate phase folder
3. Fill in task overview section
4. Update as you progress through milestones

### Documenting a Milestone

1. Reference `templates/milestone-template.md` for structure
2. Add milestone section to your task file
3. Include all required information
4. Update status and confidence

## Integration with Other Docs

### Relationship to Other Documentation

- **CLINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: High-level roadmap (what to do)
- **.implementation/**: Detailed logs (what was done, how, why)
- **docs/**: Architecture and design specs (how it works)
- **Code comments**: Line-by-line explanations (what this does)

### Cross-References

Always include references to:
- CLINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md task number
- Relevant docs/ files
- Related task files
- Commit hashes when code is merged

## Best Practices

### 1. Write as You Go
Don't wait until the end to document. Update after each milestone.

### 2. Be Specific
"Had performance issues" → "Hash computation took 50ms for 5MB files"

### 3. Include Context
Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was decided.

### 4. Track Time
Include actual time spent, not just estimates.

### 5. Preserve Mistakes
Document what didn't work and why - it's valuable learning.

### 6. Link Everything
Cross-reference task files, commits, docs, and code files.

## Git Integration

### Should These Files Be Committed?

**YES** - These files should be committed to version control because:
- They're part of the project history
- Future developers need this context
- They document the evolution of the codebase
- They preserve institutional knowledge

### .gitignore Considerations

Do NOT add `.implementation/` to .gitignore. These logs are valuable documentation.

## Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist

Before marking a task complete, verify:
- [ ] All milestones documented
- [ ] All design decisions explained
- [ ] Confidence ratings provided
- [ ] Test results included
- [ ] Lessons learned written
- [ ] Next steps identified
- [ ] Code locations listed
- [ ] Human review completed (if confidence <8)

### Human Review

For tasks requiring human review:
1. Document reviewer name and date
2. List all feedback points
3. Document actions taken for each point
4. Update confidence rating if changed
5. Get explicit sign-off

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

- **Weekly**: Review current phase progress
- **End of Phase**: Compile lessons learned across all tasks
- **Monthly**: Identify patterns and update processes

### Continuous Improvement

If you find these logs are:
- **Too detailed**: Simplify template
- **Not detailed enough**: Add required sections
- **Taking too long**: Streamline process

Update this README and templates accordingly.

## Questions?

If anything is unclear:
1. Check the templates for examples
2. Review existing task files in phase-0-foundation/
3. Refer to .clinerules/implementation-standards.md
4. Ask the human reviewer

**Phase:** Phase 0 - Foundation  
**Duration Estimate:** 3 days  
**Actual Duration:** [To be filled when complete]

## Task Overview

### Objective
Implement hash-based file change detection to prevent infinite loops between code generation and file watching.

### Problem Statement
Without proper change detection, the system creates an infinite loop:
1. Tool generates code ‚Üí saves file
2. File watcher detects change ‚Üí triggers regeneration  
3. Tool generates code again ‚Üí infinite loop

The hash-based approach distinguishes between tool-generated changes and user edits, preventing this loop.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] FileChangeTracker class implemented with hash-based detection
- [ ] Handles concurrent edits without race conditions
- [ ] Works reliably on slow file systems (network drives)
- [ ] Handles large files efficiently (>10MB)
- [ ] No infinite loops in any test scenario
- [ ] Unit test coverage >90%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Human review completed and approved

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Design & Planning
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Confidence:** [X/10]  
**Status:** üîµ Not Started  
**Time Spent:** [X hours]  

#### Activities
- [ ] Read and analyze relevant documentation
  - [ ] MVP_ROADMAP.md Phase 0.3
  - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md file system section
  - [ ] FILE_STRUCTURE_SPEC.md
- [ ] Map out the infinite loop scenario
- [ ] Design FileChangeTracker class structure
- [ ] Identify all edge cases
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams
- [ ] Document design decisions

#### Design Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice Made | Rationale | Confidence |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Change Detection Method | Timestamp-based, Hash-based, File size | Hash-based | Most reliable, handles same-content writes | [X/10] |
| Hash Algorithm | MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 | [To decide] | [To analyze speed vs collision resistance] | [X/10] |
| Pause Mechanism | Global pause, Per-file pause, Ignore list | [To decide] | [To analyze concurrent operation support] | [X/10] |
| Pause Duration | 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, User-configurable | [To decide] | [To analyze file system settle time] | [X/10] |
| Cache Strategy | Unlimited, LRU, TTL, Size-based | [To decide] | [To analyze memory usage] | [X/10] |

#### Risks Identified

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Race conditions with concurrent edits | High | Medium | [To design: file-level locking] |
| Slow hash computation for large files | High | Medium | [To research: streaming approach] |
| Memory leaks from unbounded hash storage | Medium | Low | [To design: LRU cache or cleanup] |
| Network drive latency issues | Medium | Medium | [To design: configurable delays] |
| Timeout if onAfterGenerate never called | Medium | Low | [To design: auto-cleanup timeout] |

#### Files to Create

- `src/core/types/FileChangeTypes.ts` - Type definitions
- `tests/unit/FileChangeTracker.test.ts` - Unit tests

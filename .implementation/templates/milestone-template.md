## Tips for Writing Milestones

### When to Create a New Milestone

Create a milestone when you've completed a significant step:
- Finished design/planning phase
- Completed core implementation
- Finished writing tests
- Completed human review
- Reached a major checkpoint

### What Makes a Good Milestone

**Good milestone names:**
- "Design & Planning"
- "Core Implementation"
- "Edge Case Handling"
- "Testing & Validation"
- "Human Review & Refinement"

**Bad milestone names:**
- "Day 1"
- "Work"
- "Code"

### Confidence Ratings Guide

- **9-10**: Thoroughly tested, no known issues, ready for production
- **7-8**: Working well, minor refinement may be needed
- **5-6**: Functional but needs more testing or optimization
- **3-4**: Concerning issues, requires review
- **1-2**: Serious problems, stop and get help

**Remember**: If confidence <8, human review is required.

### Time Tracking

Be honest about time spent:
- Include research/reading time
- Include debugging time
- Include time spent writing docs/tests
- Don't just count "coding time"

### Writing Implementation Notes

For each challenge, follow this pattern:
1. **Problem** - What was difficult or went wrong
2. **Impact** - How did it affect your work
3. **Solution** - What did you try
4. **Result** - Did it work? How well?
5. **Confidence** - How confident are you in this solution

### Performance Benchmarks

Only include if:
- The code is performance-critical
- There's a specific performance target
- You can measure it reliably

Format:
- **Metric**: What you're measuring (time, memory, etc.)
- **Target**: What you're aiming for
- **Actual**: What you measured
- **Test Method**: How you measured it

### Test Results

Be specific:
- Don't just say "tests pass"
- Include numbers: "15/15 tests passing"
- Include coverage: "94% statement coverage"
- Note any skipped or failing tests

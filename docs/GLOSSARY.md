# Glossary

> Definitive terminology for Rise project - ensuring consistency across all documentation.

---

## Core Concepts

### **Rise**
The name of this visual low-code builder project. Represents "rising" from traditional low-code limitations to true developer empowerment.

### **Schema Level**
Progressive feature tiers:
- **Level 1 (MVP)**: Static components, basic props
- **Level 2 (Post-MVP)**: Expressions, state, events
- **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Real-time data, AI integration

See: [SCHEMA_LEVELS.md](./SCHEMA_LEVELS.md)

### **Manifest**
The JSON file (`.lowcode/manifest.json`) that defines the complete component architecture. This is the "source of truth" for the visual editor.

### **Component Schema**
The JSON structure that defines a single component's properties, state, children, and metadata. See: [COMPONENT_SCHEMA.md](./COMPONENT_SCHEMA.md)

---

## Architecture Terms

### **Electron**
The desktop application framework (Chromium + Node.js) that powers Rise. Allows us to build cross-platform native apps with web technologies.

### **Main Process**
The Node.js process in Electron that manages the application window, file system, and system-level operations.

### **Renderer Process**
The Chromium process in Electron that renders the React UI. Sandboxed for security.

### **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**
The communication mechanism between Electron's main and renderer processes. Uses `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer`.

### **Context Bridge**
Electron's security mechanism that safely exposes APIs from main process to renderer. Prevents direct access to Node.js APIs.

---

## Component Concepts

### **Component**
A reusable UI element that can be:
- **Primitive**: Button, Input, Text, etc.
- **Composite**: UserCard, Navigation, etc.
- **Container**: Layout components that hold other components

### **Component ID**
Unique identifier for a component in the manifest, format: `comp_name_001` (semantic + numeric).

### **Display Name**
Human-readable name shown in the visual editor, e.g., "UserCard", "SubmitButton".

### **Component Hierarchy**
The parent-child tree structure of components. MVP limit: 5 levels deep, 20 children per component.

### **Props** (Properties)
Inputs to a component passed from parent. Like function parameters.

```jsx
<Button label="Click me" disabled={false} />
//      ↑ props
```

### **State**
Data that can change over time, triggering re-renders:
- **Local State**: Component-specific (useState)
- **Global State**: Shared across components (Zustand)

---

## Property Types (Schema Level 1)

### **Static Property**
A fixed value that doesn't change:
```json
{
  "type": "static",
  "value": "Hello World"
}
```

### **Prop Property**
A property passed from parent component:
```json
{
  "type": "prop",
  "dataType": "string",
  "required": true
}
```

---

## Property Types (Schema Level 2+)

### **Expression**
User-written JavaScript code that computes a value:
```json
{
  "type": "expression",
  "expression": "props.user.firstName + ' ' + props.user.lastName"
}
```

### **Computed Property**
A derived value that updates automatically (uses `useMemo`):
```json
{
  "computedProperties": {
    "fullName": {
      "expression": "props.firstName + ' ' + props.lastName"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Global Function**
User-defined reusable function available everywhere:
```json
{
  "globalFunctions": {
    "user.formatTimeAgo": {
      "code": "function formatTimeAgo(date) { ... }"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Data Flow Terms

### **Binding**
Connecting one component's output to another's input. Visual "wire" in graph editor.

### **Connection**
A data flow link between components, stored in `connections.json`.

### **Reactive Variable**
Global state that automatically updates all dependent components when changed (uses Zustand).

### **Event Handler**
Function that responds to user interactions (onClick, onSubmit, etc.). Level 2 feature.

---

## Code Generation Terms

### **Code Generator**
The engine that transforms manifest JSON into actual React code.

### **Template**
A code pattern used to generate components. E.g., function component template, class component template.

### **Framework Plugin**
An adapter that generates code for a specific framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).

See: [PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md](./PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md)

### **@rise:generated**
Comment marker in generated code indicating it was created by Rise:
```jsx
/**
 * @rise:generated
 * DO NOT EDIT: Changes will be overwritten
 */
```

### **Protected Region**
Code section marked to prevent regeneration:
```jsx
/* @rise:start-preserve */
// User code here - won't be overwritten
/* @rise:end-preserve */
```

---

## Security Terms

### **Expression Sandbox**
Isolated execution environment for user JavaScript code using VM2 or Web Workers. Prevents malicious code execution.

See: [SECURITY_SPEC.md](./SECURITY_SPEC.md)

### **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**
Parsed representation of JavaScript code used for security validation and code generation.

### **Input Sanitization**
Cleaning and validating user input to prevent injection attacks.

### **API Key Manager**
Secure storage system for Claude/OpenAI API keys using OS keychain (keytar).

### **Cost Tracking**
Monitoring API usage to prevent runaway expenses. Default: $10/day budget.

### **Path Traversal**
Security attack where user input tries to access files outside allowed directory (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`). Prevented by input sanitization.

---

## AI Terms

### **AI Copilot**
Rise's philosophy: AI assists but user always in control. Not "autopilot" where AI makes all decisions.

### **AI Code Review**
AI-powered analysis of generated code for performance, security, and best practices. Level 3 feature.

### **Prompt Template**
Pre-defined prompt structure for AI to generate specific types of components.

### **Token**
Unit of text for AI models (~4 characters). Costs calculated per token.

### **Context Window**
Amount of text AI can "see" at once (typically 100k-200k tokens for Claude).

---

## Testing Terms

### **Unit Test**
Test of a single function or component in isolation. Target: 80% coverage for core.

### **Integration Test**
Test of multiple components working together (e.g., component tree → manifest → code generation).

### **E2E Test** (End-to-End)
Test of complete user workflows using Playwright (e.g., create project, add components, preview).

### **Test Coverage**
Percentage of code executed by tests. MVP target: 80% for core engine.

### **Test ID**
HTML attribute for reliable test selection: `data-testid="user-card"`.

---

## File System Terms

### **Static vs Expression**
- **Static**: Fixed value (Level 1)
- **Expression**: Computed value with JavaScript (Level 2)

### **Local vs Global State**
- **Local**: Component-specific, not shared
- **Global**: Shared across components

### **Framework vs Plugin**
- **Framework**: UI library (React, Vue, Svelte)
- **Plugin**: Adapter that generates code for a framework

### **Preview vs Generated App**
- **Preview**: Inside Rise for development
- **Generated App**: Standalone app deployed separately

---

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

### **"Bubble Mode"**
Treating Rise like a pure no-code tool. Remember: you can write real code!

### **"Over-AIing"**
Letting AI do everything without understanding. Always review AI output.

### **"Scope Creeping"**
Adding features beyond MVP plan. Stick to Schema Level 1 for MVP.

### **"Lock-in Thinking"**
Assuming you're stuck with Rise. Generated code is yours to take anywhere.

### **"Magic Syntax"**
Rise doesn't use special syntax. It's just JavaScript!

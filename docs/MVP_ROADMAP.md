# MVP Roadmap

## Vision & Scope

**Goal**: Build a functional Electron-based visual low-code builder that can generate React components with AI assistance, providing a solid foundation for future expansion.

**Target MVP Timeline**: 12-16 weeks (with AI assistance via Cline/Claude)

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Can create new React project
- âœ… Can add/edit components visually
- âœ… Can set properties and create connections
- âœ… Generates clean, working React code
- âœ… Basic preview functionality
- âœ… AI assists with component generation

---

## Development Approach

### AI vs Human Split

**AI/Cline Can Handle (80% of MVP)**:
- âœ… Electron app boilerplate and setup
- âœ… Basic React UI components (panels, trees, forms)
- âœ… Monaco editor integration
- âœ… File system operations (read/write/watch)
- âœ… JSON manifest management (CRUD operations)
- âœ… Simple code generation (template-based)
- âœ… Vite project scaffolding
- âœ… Basic IPC communication
- âœ… UI styling with Tailwind
- âœ… Form validation and state management

**Human Developer Needed (20% of MVP)**:
- ðŸ”¨ Complex AST parsing (for bidirectional sync - post-MVP)
- ðŸ”¨ Advanced debugging runtime architecture
- ðŸ”¨ Performance optimization for large projects
- ðŸ”¨ Robust error handling edge cases
- ðŸ”¨ Plugin system architecture decisions
- ðŸ”¨ Security considerations and review
- ðŸ”¨ UX refinement and polish
- ðŸ”¨ Testing strategy and implementation

**Strategy**: Start with AI doing bulk of implementation, bring in human developer for architectural reviews and complex features.

- Test with various component types
- Human review generated code patterns

**Risk**: Preview fails or crashes frequently
**Mitigation**:
- Error boundaries everywhere
- Graceful degradation
- Clear error messages
- Sandbox preview properly

**Risk**: File watching causes infinite loops
**Mitigation**:
- Debounce file events
- Track generation timestamps
- Ignore tool-generated changes
- Human review watching logic

### Scope Risks

**Risk**: Features creep, timeline extends
**Mitigation**:
- Strict MVP feature list
- Push nice-to-haves to post-MVP
- Regular scope reviews
- Time-box implementation

**Risk**: AI can't handle complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Break features into smaller tasks

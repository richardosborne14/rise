# MVP Roadmap (Revised)

## Vision & Scope

**Goal**: Build a focused visual low-code builder that nails the core experience: visual component editing + AI assistance + clean React code generation. Architecture designed for future plugin extensibility without building the full system yet.

**Target MVP Timeline**: 8-10 weeks (with AI assistance via Cline/Claude)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Can create new React project with standard structure
- ‚úÖ Visual component tree editing (add/remove/reorder)
- ‚úÖ Property editing with expressions + custom functions
- ‚úÖ AI-powered component generation and suggestions
- ‚úÖ Live preview with hot reload
- ‚úÖ Clean, documented React code output
- ‚úÖ Plugin-ready architecture (interfaces defined, not implemented)

---

## Core Philosophy: Focused + Future-Ready

### What We're Building (MVP)
- **Visual Component Editor**: Intuitive tree-based component management
- **Smart Property System**: Simple expressions + powerful custom functions
- **AI Copilot**: Generation, suggestions, and code review
- **Clean Code Output**: Standard React that any developer can extend
- **Plugin-Ready Architecture**: Interfaces defined for future extensibility

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- ‚ùå Full plugin system implementation
- ‚ùå Multiple framework support  
- ‚ùå Step-through debugger
- ‚ùå Bidirectional sync (code ‚Üí manifest)
- ‚ùå Visual connection editor
- ‚ùå Complex state management UI
- ‚ùå Advanced deployment pipelines

### Why This Scope Works
1. **Faster Time to Market**: Core value in 8-10 weeks vs 16+ weeks
2. **Validated Learning**: Get user feedback on core experience first
3. **Solid Foundation**: Architecture ready for planned expansions
4. **AI Advantage**: Leverage current AI hype with practical tooling

## Architecture Principles for Plugin Readiness

### 1. Clean Separation of Concerns
```typescript
// Plugin-ready architecture
interface FrameworkPlugin {
  generateComponent(manifest: ComponentManifest): string;
  parseComponent(code: string): ComponentManifest;
  getProjectTemplate(): ProjectTemplate;
}

// Current React implementation follows this interface
class ReactPlugin implements FrameworkPlugin {
  generateComponent(manifest) {
    // React-specific generation
  }
}
```

### 2. Semantic Abstractions
```json
// Framework-agnostic manifest format
{
  "type": "Button",
  "semantics": {
    "concept": "Interactive button element",
    "triggers": ["onClick", "onHover"]
  },
  "properties": {
    "onClick": {
      "type": "eventHandler",
      "action": "navigation",
      "target": "/dashboard"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Extensible Property System
```json
// Plugin can extend property types
{
  "customProperty": {
    "type": "vue:computed",  // Vue-specific property type
    "expression": "firstName + ' ' + lastName"
  }
}
```
